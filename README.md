Welcome to my GitHub 👋

My name is Edgar Tapia, currently I´m working as Sr. React Frontend Developer in Softtek 😎

Others things important about my are: 

 - I´m 35 years of experience in the world, other people say "age" but I like say Experience 

 - I´m a Bussiness Administrator, but the life put my here, and now I´ve more experience as developer than Administratator, and I have to said that I love create web apps more than FODAS 💻

 - I´m currently studing a Games Developer Engenier, I´m starting, but the first step is the most important and dificult, and I already gave it. ❤️

Technologies I currently use:

HTML ||  CSS || JavaScript || TypeScript || Reactjs || Redux || Electron || Bulma || MaterialUI || Boostrap || Postgress || mongoDB || Mongosee || Nextjs || Apollo Server || Apollo Cliente || Graphql || Golang || Dart || Flutter

Next steps.
